# Modern-Art

## Requirements
This is a Python program that can be run via the terminal. You will need to install from the requirement.txt file. 
This can be done by running pip install -r 'requirements.txt' from your command line. Then you can run the program
and generate cool random art by running python create_art.py. You can also specify a number of times you would like
to generate art by optionally running python create_art.py -n NUM. Where NUM is the number of art pieces you'd like
to create.

The code to make this particular picture looks like this
<pre><code>
lambda x, y: sin(pi)+tan(x)+tan(y)*tan(x*y)
lambda x, y: tan(x*y) - sin(y)
</code></pre>
